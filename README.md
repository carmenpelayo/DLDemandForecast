# Deep Learning for Demand Forecasting in Local Businesses 
April, 2024

## Introduction
This project addresses the critical need for effective demand forecasting in local businesses, utilizing deep learning methods. By analyzing over two decades of data from a Connecticut cafe, this project aims to identify and implement a deep learning algorithm that provides highly accurate demand projections, aiding in operational planning and strategic decision-making.

## Objectives
- To provide accurate short-term demand forecasting for operational planning.
- To identify long-term trends affecting strategic business decisions.
- To investigate the accuracy of standard forecasting methods (ARIMA, GRUs, LSTMs) versus state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms (Transformers, Time-series Dense Encoders).

## Datasets
Utilizes a dataset from a local café, including meal counts, weather conditions, and expenditure, over 23 years.

## Methodology
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns.
- Development of forecasting models using deep learning methods.
- Evaluation of model performance using MAE and MAPE metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- Standard Forecasting Models (as a baseline): ARIMA, LSTM, GRU.
- State-of-the-art Forecasting Models: TiDE, Time-LLM, etc.
