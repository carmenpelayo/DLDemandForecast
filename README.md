# Deep Learning for Demand Forecasting in Local Businesses 
April, 2024

## Introduction
This project addresses the critical need for effective demand forecasting in local businesses, utilizing deep learning methods. By analyzing over two decades of data from a Connecticut cafe, we aim to develop a tool that provides highly accurate demand projections, aiding in operational planning and strategic decision-making.

## Objectives
- To provide accurate short-term demand forecasting for operational planning.
- To identify long-term trends affecting strategic business decisions.

## Datasets
Utilizes a detailed dataset from a local café, including meal counts, weather conditions, and expenditure, emphasizing the value of exploratory data analysis for meaningful insight extraction.

## Methodology
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns.
- Development of forecasting models using deep learning methods.
- Evaluation of model performance using MAE and MAPE metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Traditional Statistical Models (as a baseline): ARIMA, LSTM, GRU.
- Deep Learning: TiDE, Time-LLM, DistilBERT for NLP tasks.
- Data Analysis and Visualization: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.
